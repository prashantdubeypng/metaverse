# Proximity-Based Video Chat Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive proximity-based video chat system for the metaverse space, where users automatically connect to video calls when they are within 2 tiles of each other.

## Key Features

### 1. **Proximity-Based Video Calls**
- **Automatic Connection**: Users automatically connect to video calls when within 2 tiles distance
- **Automatic Disconnection**: Video calls end when users move away from each other
- **Real-time Position Tracking**: Uses WebSocket for real-time position updates
- **SDP Exchange**: Proper WebRTC signaling through the unified WebSocket system

### 2. **Modern Space Interface**
- **Active Users Sidebar**: Left sidebar showing all connected users with their positions
- **Proximity Indicators**: Visual indicators showing which users are nearby
- **Real-time Status**: Connection status and user count display
- **Responsive Design**: Modern dark theme with smooth animations

### 3. **Interactive Space Canvas**
- **Grid-based Movement**: 20x20 pixel grid system for precise positioning
- **Visual Proximity Circles**: Shows 2-tile radius around users
- **Zoom Controls**: Pan, zoom, and navigate the space
- **Click-to-Move**: Click anywhere to move your avatar
- **Keyboard Controls**: WASD or arrow keys for movement

### 4. **Video Call UI**
- **Compact Window**: Small video call window positioned on the right side
- **Camera Controls**: Toggle camera, microphone, and end call
- **Multiple Participants**: Supports multiple users in proximity
- **Auto-positioning**: Automatically appears when users are nearby

### 5. **WebSocket Integration**
- **Unified WebSocket Service**: Uses existing WebSocket infrastructure
- **Real-time Updates**: Position updates, user join/leave events
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection and error handling
- **Message Broadcasting**: Efficient message routing between users

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (WebSocket Server)
- **VideoCallManager**: Handles proximity detection and call management
- **User Movement Tracking**: Real-time position updates with 2-tile proximity detection
- **WebRTC Signaling**: SDP offer/answer exchange through WebSocket
- **Automatic Call Management**: Starts/ends calls based on proximity

### Frontend Components
- **SpacePage**: Main space interface with sidebar and canvas
- **SpaceCanvas**: Interactive canvas with grid system and user visualization
- **ProximityVideoCallUI**: Compact video call interface
- **Active Users Sidebar**: Real-time user list with proximity indicators

### Key Files Modified/Created

```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Join a Space**: Navigate to any space from the dashboard
2. **Connect to Live Session**: Click "Connect" to join the WebSocket session
3. **Move Around**: Use WASD keys or click to move your avatar
4. **Automatic Video Calls**: Get within 2 tiles of another user for automatic video connection
5. **Control Video**: Use the compact video window controls for camera/mic

### Movement Controls
- **W/↑**: Move up
- **S/↓**: Move down  
- **A/←**: Move left
- **D/→**: Move right
- **Mouse Click**: Click anywhere to move to that position

### Video Call Features
- **Automatic Start**: Video calls start automatically when users are within 2 tiles
- **Automatic End**: Calls end when users move away from each other
- **Camera Toggle**: Turn camera on/off during calls
- **Microphone Toggle**: Mute/unmute during calls
- **Manual End**: End call manually if needed

## Configuration

### Proximity Distance
The proximity distance is set to 2 tiles (40 pixels) and can be adjusted in:
```typescript
const PROXIMITY_DISTANCE = 2; // in SpacePage component
```

### Grid System
The grid system uses 20x20 pixel cells:
```typescript
const GRID_SIZE = 20; // pixels per grid cell
```

### Video Call Window
The video call window is positioned on the right side and can be customized:
```typescript
// In SpacePage component
<div className="fixed top-24 right-4 z-50">
  <ProximityVideoCallUI className="w-80 max-h-96" />
</div>
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalable**: Uses existing WebSocket infrastructure
2. **Real-time**: Immediate proximity detection and video connection
3. **User-friendly**: Automatic video calls with manual controls
4. **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with visual feedback
5. **Efficient**: Minimal bandwidth usage with proximity-based connections

## Future Enhancements

1. **Group Video Calls**: Support for multiple users in proximity
2. **Audio Spatial Effects**: 3D audio based on user positions
3. **Screen Sharing**: Share screens during proximity calls
4. **Call History**: Track and display recent video interactions
5. **Custom Proximity Settings**: User-configurable proximity distances
6. **Mobile Support**: Touch controls for mobile devices

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ✅ Multiple users in the same space
- ✅ Proximity detection (2-tile distance)
- ✅ Automatic video call start/end
- ✅ WebRTC signaling through WebSocket
- ✅ Real-time position updates
- ✅ UI responsiveness and controls
- ✅ Build compilation and type checking

## Dependencies

All features use existing dependencies:
- React 18+ for UI components
- Next.js for routing and SSR
- WebRTC for video calls
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Canvas API for space visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
