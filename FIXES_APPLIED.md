# Critical Fixes for Metaverse Space Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Avatar Visibility Problem
**Problem**: New users joining a space couldn't see existing users' avatars.

**Root Cause**: 
- Backend was sending `user-joined-space` with direct `{x, y}` properties
- Frontend was expecting `{spawn: {x, y}}` format
- This mismatch caused the frontend to default to position `(1, 1)` for all existing users

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `metaverse/apps/ws/src/User.ts` (Line ~240)
- **Change**: Modified broadcast to include BOTH formats for backward compatibility:
```typescript
{
  userId: this.userId,
  username: this.username,
  spawn: { x: this.x, y: this.y },  // Added
  x: this.x,                          // Kept
  y: this.y                           // Kept
}
```
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/space/[id]/page.tsx` (Line ~786)
- **Change**: Updated handler to extract coordinates from either format:
```typescript
const gridX = payload.spawn?.x ?? payload.x ?? 1;
const gridY = payload.spawn?.y ?? payload.y ?? 1;
```

### 2. ✅ Movement Rejection Bug (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: User movements were being rejected by the backend even for 1-step movements.

**Root Cause**: 
- **Rounding Error with Math.round()**
  - Frontend was using `Math.round()` to convert pixel coordinates to grid coordinates
  - Example: User at pixel 790 → 790/20 = 39.5 → `Math.round(39.5) = 40`
  - Backend max grid for 800px width: `floor(800/20) - 1 = 39`
  - Result: Movement to grid 40 was REJECTED (40 > 39)

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/space/[id]/page.tsx` (Line ~211-212)
- **Change**: Changed `Math.round()` to `Math.floor()`:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const gridX = Math.round(clampedX / GRID_SIZE);
const gridY = Math.round(clampedY / GRID_SIZE);

// AFTER:
const gridX = Math.floor(clampedX / GRID_SIZE);
const gridY = Math.floor(clampedY / GRID_SIZE);
```

**Why Math.floor() is correct**:
- Pixel 0-19 → Grid 0 ✅
- Pixel 20-39 → Grid 1 ✅
- Pixel 780-799 → Grid 39 ✅ (max for 800px space)
- Matches backend calculation: `floor(width / 20) - 1`

### 3. ✅ Video Call Proximity Detection Fix
**Problem**: Proximity video calls weren't working properly due to coordinate inconsistencies.

**Root Cause**:
- Proximity video call service was also using `Math.round()` for coordinate conversion
- This caused misalignment with the movement system
- Users at X.5 positions would be calculated differently

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `frontend/src/services/proximityVideoCall.ts` (Line ~103, ~143-145)
- **Change**: Changed all `Math.round()` to `Math.floor()` for coordinate calculations:
```typescript
// Position update:
const gridX = Math.floor(x / 20);
const gridY = Math.floor(y / 20);

// Proximity detection:
const currentGridX = Math.floor(this.state.localPosition.x / GRID_SIZE);
const currentGridY = Math.floor(this.state.localPosition.y / GRID_SIZE);
const userGridX = Math.floor(user.x / GRID_SIZE);
const userGridY = Math.floor(user.y / GRID_SIZE);
```

---

## Scaling Consistency

### Coordinate System
All systems now use consistent coordinate conversion:

**Frontend → Backend (Movement/Position Updates)**:
```typescript
pixelCoordinate → Math.floor(pixelCoordinate / 20) → gridCoordinate
```

**Backend → Frontend (User Positions)**:
```typescript
gridCoordinate → gridCoordinate * 20 → pixelCoordinate
```

**Space Boundaries**:
- Backend calculates max grid: `Math.floor(spacePixelWidth / 20) - 1`
- Frontend clamps pixels: `min(pixelPosition, spacePixelWidth - 20)`
- Both ensure user stays within valid bounds

---

## Race Condition Prevention

The current implementation already prevents race conditions by:

1. **No Optimistic Updates**: Frontend doesn't update position until server confirms
2. **Server Authority**: Backend validates all movements before broadcasting
3. **Rejection Handling**: Frontend restores to last known valid position on `move-rejected`

**How it works**:
```
User presses arrow key
 ↓
Frontend calculates new position
 ↓
Frontend sends 'move' message (position NOT updated yet)
 ↓
Backend validates movement
 ↓
Backend broadcasts 'user-moved' OR sends 'move-rejected'
 ↓
Frontend updates position based on server response
```

This prevents the "avatar gets lost" issue because:
- If movement is rejected, user stays at current position
- If movement is accepted, position is updated to validated coordinates
- No intermediate states where user position is uncertain

---

## Video Call Signaling

The WebRTC signaling flow is working correctly:

```
User A enters proximity range of User B
 ↓
Frontend detects proximity via handleNearbyUsersUpdate()
 ↓
Frontend creates RTCPeerConnection
 ↓
Frontend sends offer via 'proximity-video-call-signal'
 ↓
Backend relays signal to User B
 ↓
User B receives offer and sends answer
 ↓
WebRTC connection established
```

**Key components**:
- `ProximityVideoCallManager` handles WebRTC connections
- `useProximityVideoCall` hook manages React state
- Backend relays signaling messages between users
- Proximity is calculated using Manhattan distance (max 2 grid units)

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Avatar Visibility
1. Open space with User A
2. Move User A to any position
3. Open same space with User B
4. **Expected**: User B should see User A's avatar at correct position
5. **Expected**: User A should see User B's avatar appear

### Test 2: Movement at Boundaries
1. Move user to near the edge of space (e.g., x=780 for 800px width)
2. Try moving right by 1 step
3. **Expected**: Movement should be ACCEPTED (not rejected)
4. Try moving beyond boundary
5. **Expected**: Movement should be REJECTED with reason

### Test 3: Video Call Proximity
1. Place User A at grid position (5, 5)
2. Place User B at grid position (7, 5) - distance = 2
3. **Expected**: Video call should auto-start
4. Move User B to (8, 5) - distance = 3
5. **Expected**: Video call should auto-end

### Test 4: Rapid Movement
1. Press and hold arrow key
2. **Expected**: User should move smoothly without getting "lost"
3. **Expected**: No movement rejections unless hitting boundary

## Configuration Constants

All systems use these constants (ensure consistency):

```typescript
GRID_SIZE = 20              // pixels per grid unit
PROXIMITY_DISTANCE = 2      // grid units for video call activation
```

**Pixel to Grid Calculation**:
```typescript
gridCoord = Math.floor(pixelCoord / GRID_SIZE)
```

**Grid to Pixel Calculation**:
```typescript
pixelCoord = gridCoord * GRID_SIZE
```

**Boundary Validation (Backend)**:
```typescript
maxGridX = Math.floor(spaceWidth / GRID_SIZE) - 1
maxGridY = Math.floor(spaceHeight / GRID_SIZE) - 1
valid = (x >= 0 && x <= maxGridX && y >= 0 && y <= maxGridY)
```

2. **Add position interpolation** for smoother avatar movement
3. **Add network latency compensation** for better responsiveness
4. **Add error recovery** for WebRTC connection failures
5. **Add position persistence** in Redis to survive server restarts
