# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The video call feature enables users in the metaverse to participate in two types of video communications: multi-party meeting room calls when users are in designated meeting room coordinates, and peer-to-peer calls when users are in regular proximity outside meeting rooms. The system includes proximity detection, meeting room detection, notification management, and WebRTC-based video calling with support for both group conferences and individual calls.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Meeting Room Detection and Multi-Party Calls

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want to automatically join group video calls when I enter designated meeting room coordinates, so that I can participate in conference-style meetings with multiple participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters meeting room coordinates THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the meeting room and offer to join the group call
2. WHEN a user joins a meeting room call THEN the system SHALL connect them to all other participants in that room using a multi-party WebRTC configuration
3. WHEN a user leaves meeting room coordinates THEN the system SHALL automatically disconnect them from the group call
4. WHEN multiple users are in the same meeting room THEN the system SHALL display all participants' video streams in a grid layout
5. WHEN a new user joins an active meeting room THEN the system SHALL add their stream to existing participants' views
6. IF a meeting room has a participant limit THEN the system SHALL enforce the maximum capacity and queue additional users

### Requirement 2: Proximity Detection and Peer-to-Peer Discovery

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want to see other users who are within video call range outside meeting rooms, so that I can initiate one-on-one video calls with nearby participants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user moves within 10 units of another user outside meeting rooms THEN the system SHALL detect the proximity and update the nearby users list
2. WHEN users are within 10 units outside meeting rooms THEN the system SHALL display them in a sidebar with their avatar and username
3. WHEN a user moves beyond 10 units THEN the system SHALL remove them from the nearby users list within 5 seconds
4. IF a user is currently in a meeting room THEN the system SHALL not show them as available for peer-to-peer calls
5. WHEN the proximity list updates THEN the system SHALL maintain real-time synchronization across all connected clients

### Requirement 3: Peer-to-Peer Call Request Management

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want to send video call requests to nearby users outside meeting rooms and manage incoming requests, so that I can establish one-on-one video connections with consent from both parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a nearby user in the sidebar (outside meeting rooms) THEN the system SHALL send a peer-to-peer video call request to that user
2. WHEN a user receives a peer-to-peer video call request THEN the system SHALL display a notification with accept/reject options
3. WHEN a user accepts a peer-to-peer call request THEN the system SHALL initiate the direct WebRTC connection establishment
4. WHEN a user rejects a peer-to-peer call request THEN the system SHALL notify the requester and close the request
5. IF a call request is not responded to within 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically expire the request
6. WHEN a user is already in a meeting room or peer-to-peer call THEN the system SHALL automatically reject new incoming requests with an appropriate message

### Requirement 4: Dual-Mode WebRTC Video Connections

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want to have high-quality video calls in both meeting room and peer-to-peer modes, so that I can communicate effectively in different contexts within the virtual environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users are in a meeting room THEN the system SHALL establish a multi-party WebRTC connection using a media server or mesh topology
2. WHEN users accept a peer-to-peer call THEN the system SHALL establish a direct WebRTC connection between the two participants
3. WHEN a meeting room connection is established THEN the system SHALL display all participants' video streams in a responsive grid layout
4. WHEN a peer-to-peer connection is established THEN the system SHALL display both video streams in a two-person call interface
5. IF any connection fails or drops THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically up to 3 times
6. WHEN audio/video permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options
7. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL adjust video quality automatically to maintain connection stability

### Requirement 5: Adaptive Call Interface and Controls

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want intuitive controls during both meeting room and peer-to-peer video calls, so that I can manage my audio, video, and call settings effectively in different call contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any call is active THEN the system SHALL display controls for mute/unmute, video on/off, and leave/end call
2. WHEN a user mutes their microphone THEN the system SHALL indicate the muted state to all participants in the call
3. WHEN a user turns off their video THEN the system SHALL show a placeholder or avatar instead of the video stream
4. WHEN a user clicks leave call in a meeting room THEN the system SHALL disconnect them while maintaining the call for other participants
5. WHEN a user clicks end call in a peer-to-peer call THEN the system SHALL terminate the connection for both participants
6. WHEN the call interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide different layouts for meeting room (grid) vs peer-to-peer (side-by-side) calls
7. IF the call interface overlaps with metaverse navigation THEN the system SHALL provide options to reposition or minimize the interface

### Requirement 6: Context-Aware Notification System

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want to receive clear notifications about video call activities and meeting room opportunities, so that I don't miss important call requests or meeting room invitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a peer-to-peer video call request is received THEN the system SHALL display a prominent notification with sound alert
2. WHEN a user approaches a meeting room with active participants THEN the system SHALL display a meeting room join notification
3. WHEN a call request is accepted or rejected THEN the system SHALL notify the requester immediately
4. WHEN a call connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an error notification with retry options
5. IF notification permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL use in-app notifications as fallback
6. WHEN multiple notifications are pending THEN the system SHALL prioritize meeting room notifications over peer-to-peer requests
7. WHEN a user is in do-not-disturb mode THEN the system SHALL suppress audio alerts but maintain visual notifications

### Requirement 7: Privacy and Security for Dual-Mode Calls

**User Story:** As a metaverse user, I want control over my video call privacy and security in both meeting rooms and peer-to-peer calls, so that I can protect my personal information and manage my availability in different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets their status to unavailable THEN the system SHALL not show them in other users' nearby lists and SHALL not auto-join meeting rooms
2. WHEN video/audio data is transmitted in any call mode THEN the system SHALL use encrypted WebRTC connections
3. WHEN a user blocks another user THEN the system SHALL prevent all video call interactions and exclude them from shared meeting rooms
4. IF a user reports inappropriate behavior in any call context THEN the system SHALL log the incident and provide moderation tools
5. WHEN call history is stored THEN the system SHALL only retain metadata (not actual call content) with user consent for both call types
6. WHEN users disconnect from any call type THEN the system SHALL ensure all media streams are properly terminated and cleaned up
7. WHEN a user enters a meeting room THEN the system SHALL display current participants before auto-joining to ensure consent
