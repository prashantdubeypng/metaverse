# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The proximity-based video calling feature enables automatic connection between users when they come within a specified radius of each other. The system uses location data to detect proximity and establishes video calls without requiring manual connection requests or acceptance. Users are automatically connected when within 2 tiles radius and disconnected when they move outside this range.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to automatically connect to nearby users for video calls when I'm within proximity range, so that I can have spontaneous conversations without manual connection steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins the system THEN the system SHALL capture and store the user's IP address
2. WHEN a user is within 2 tiles radius of another user THEN the system SHALL automatically establish a video connection between them
3. WHEN users move outside the 2 tiles radius THEN the system SHALL automatically disconnect the video call
4. WHEN a video connection is established THEN the system SHALL NOT require any manual acceptance or request from either user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to only connect me with one other user at a time, so that conversations remain focused and manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two users are already connected THEN the system SHALL NOT allow a third user to join the connection
2. WHEN a third user comes within radius of two connected users THEN the system SHALL place the third user in a waiting state
3. WHEN one of the connected users leaves the radius THEN the system SHALL automatically connect the waiting user with the remaining user
4. WHEN multiple users are waiting THEN the system SHALL connect users based on first-come-first-served basis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to accurately track my location and proximity to other users, so that connections happen reliably when I'm close to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user joins the room THEN the system SHALL continuously track their location coordinates
2. WHEN calculating proximity THEN the system SHALL use a 2 tiles radius as the connection threshold
3. WHEN a user's location changes THEN the system SHALL update proximity calculations in real-time
4. WHEN proximity calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL ensure accuracy within the defined radius

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle connection state changes smoothly, so that I experience seamless transitions when moving in and out of proximity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users enter proximity range THEN the system SHALL establish the video connection within 2 seconds
2. WHEN users leave proximity range THEN the system SHALL terminate the connection within 2 seconds
3. WHEN connection state changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audio/video quality during transitions
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection attempts gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and manage proximity-based connections, so that I can ensure system performance and handle edge cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users connect or disconnect THEN the system SHALL log connection events with timestamps and user identifiers
2. WHEN system resources are under load THEN the system SHALL prioritize existing connections over new connection attempts
3. WHEN users experience connection issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN the system detects anomalous behavior THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate safeguards to maintain service stability
