# Frontend Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend implementation for the proximity-based video calling system provides the user interface and client-side WebRTC handling for automatic video connections. The system integrates with existing user authentication, WebSocket connections, and position tracking to deliver seamless proximity-based video calls without manual connection requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video call interface to automatically appear when I'm connected to someone nearby, so that I can immediately start communicating without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend sends a 'video-call-start' message THEN the frontend SHALL automatically display the video call interface
2. WHEN a video call is established THEN the frontend SHALL show both local and remote video streams
3. WHEN the video call interface appears THEN the frontend SHALL not require any user confirmation or acceptance
4. WHEN a video call ends THEN the frontend SHALL automatically hide the video call interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control my camera and microphone during video calls, so that I can manage my privacy and communication preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video call is active THEN the frontend SHALL provide mute/unmute controls for microphone
2. WHEN a video call is active THEN the frontend SHALL provide camera on/off controls
3. WHEN I toggle camera or microphone THEN the frontend SHALL immediately apply the changes to the media stream
4. WHEN I change media settings THEN the frontend SHALL persist my preferences for future calls

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual indicators of nearby users and call status, so that I understand the proximity-based connection system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other users are within proximity range THEN the frontend SHALL display proximity indicators
2. WHEN a video call is connecting THEN the frontend SHALL show connection status and progress
3. WHEN call quality changes THEN the frontend SHALL display connection quality indicators
4. WHEN users are in a queue waiting to connect THEN the frontend SHALL show queue status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video call system to integrate seamlessly with my existing space navigation, so that calls don't interfere with my movement and interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I move within the space THEN the video call interface SHALL remain accessible and functional
2. WHEN a video call is active THEN the frontend SHALL continue to send position updates to the backend
3. WHEN the video call interface is displayed THEN the frontend SHALL not block space navigation controls
4. WHEN I interact with space elements THEN the video call SHALL continue running in the background

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the video call frontend to integrate with existing authentication and WebSocket systems, so that implementation is consistent with current architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing video calls THEN the frontend SHALL use existing user authentication data
2. WHEN sending WebRTC signaling THEN the frontend SHALL use the existing WebSocket connection
3. WHEN handling video call events THEN the frontend SHALL integrate with existing message handling patterns
4. WHEN managing user state THEN the frontend SHALL work with existing user management systems
